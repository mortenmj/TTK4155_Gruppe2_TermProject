croutine. h 
\begin{DoxyPre}
 crSTART( xCoRoutineHandle xHandle );\end{DoxyPre}


This macro M\-U\-S\-T always be called at the start of a co-\/routine function.

Example usage\-: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
Co-routine to be created.
 void vACoRoutine( xCoRoutineHandle xHandle, unsigned portBASE\_TYPE uxIndex )
 \{
Variables in co-routines must be declared static if they must maintain value across a blocking call.
 static long ulAVariable;\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Must start every co-routine with a call to crSTART();
     crSTART( xHandle );\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}     for( ;; )
     \{
Co-routine functionality goes here.
     \}\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Must end every co-routine with a call to crEND();
     crEND();
 \}\end{DoxyPre}
